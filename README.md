# AngularTailwindAnt

A boilerplate is a starting point for building a Angular application. It typically includes the basic files and directories that are needed for a Angular application, as well as some basic code that can be used to get started.

This boilerplate uses Angular, Ant Design, and Tailwind CSS. It includes the following:

A basic Angular application An Ant Design theme A Tailwind CSS configuration A unit testing framework A linter

The basic Angular application is a simple todo list application that uses Ant Design and Tailwind CSS. The unit testing framework is Jest, and the linter is ESLint.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
